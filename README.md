## General Information

The Bike sharing service is to share the bike to an individual on the short term basis for price. The computer system allows the user to rent the bike 
by entering their username and paasword. They can park the bike in the same system of different location. But in time this bussiness got affected.

The idea is to generate the model that checks the data available and find the reason for the dip in their business. There are several factors to affect
the business, the machine learning model need to give us the best way to tackle the problem.

## Technologies Used
- numpy - version 1.20.3
- pandas - version 1.3.4
- seaborn - version 0.11.2
- statsmodels - version 0.12.2

## Conclusions
- On analysing data, it was observed that, the linear regression model was able to predict bike demand precisely with an R2 Score of 78%

- As a result the top influencer based on our model are 

	1) Temperature, Year (Positively Influencing)
	2) weathersit_3 - Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds (Negatively Influencing) 

	So it is better to give more importance to them, while planning to achieve more bike hiring.
